# Performance definitions

This repository contains definitions and experimental data for Digital Music Object (DMO) 
descriptions centred on performances.  This repository extends the exploratory Digital 
Music Object design initially created for the Carolan Guitar's story, and is being 
created as an activity by Oxford University's OeRC as part of the EPSRC-funded 
FAST-IMPACt project.
