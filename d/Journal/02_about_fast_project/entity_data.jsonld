  "rdfs:comment": "The [FAST project](http://www.semanticaudio.ac.uk) \r\nbrings the very latest technologies to bear on the entire recorded music industry, end-to-end, producer to consumer.\r\n\r\nThis demonstrator system aims to explore the application of semantic technologies to aspects of live performances.  The goal is to place individual performances in the context of a wider body of work by the composers and performers who contribute to a performance.  It forms part of an exploration of interactions between physical (real-world) and virtual (online) entities in the context of musical performance.",
