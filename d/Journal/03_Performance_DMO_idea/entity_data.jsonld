  "rdfs:comment": "# What is this data all about?\r\n\r\nThe FAST project is looking at ways to apply Semantic Web technologies to enhance the entire chain of music production, distribution and consumption.  This data is for is an exploratory demonstrator within that project that looks at the aspect of live performances, and how they may be connected to the other parts of that chain.\r\n\r\nThere follows a rough description of what we're aiming for:\r\n\r\n# \"Performance DMO\" demonstrator proposal \r\n\r\nDigital Music Objects (DMOs) act as a kind of \"glue\" layer to pull together other aspects of the project.  The \"Performance DMO\" is a suggestion to demonstrate such connecting capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe \"Performance DMO\" ideas were discussed in a brainstorming breakout session at the (first) FAST all hands meeting.  The group was tasked with coming up with ideas relating to musical performance, and the underlying idea here is a suggestion for using digital technology to create a richer, less ephemeral connection between performers and their audiences. \r\n\r\nThis proposal is informed in part by my experiences of attending concerts by less well-known musicians, often given by ensembles of 1-5 performers and held in smaller local venues with an audience size in the range of 100-300 (e.g. Nettlebed Folk Club, Abingdon's Unicorn Theatre, Oxford's Holywell Music Room).  These performances are often given as part of a tour of 10-30 dates within a period of a couple of months or so.  Because these performances are relatively easy and inexpensive to access, I have often seen performers whose works I had very little prior exposure to.  The performers themselves seem to be using the concerts in part to promote themselves and their work.  Thus, I posit there is a desire on both sides to create a deeper connection between the performers and audiences. \r\n\r\n\r\n## User stories \r\n\r\n1. As an attendee of concerts by little-known musicians and bands, I would like to have access to information and recordings related to a performance I have attended so that I can further explore the music and its associations, with a view to possible purchase of recordings by the performers seen, or attending further performances by them. \r\n\r\n2. As a \"small-time\" or \"up-and-coming\" performing professional musician, I would like to create a longer-lasting connection with the audiences who attend my performances, and encourage them to purchase recordings of my music or attend further performances. \r\n\r\n3. [Steve B] As a concert organizer and musician, I would like to be able to discover or harvest and access media from other people at the event, and (with permission) add them to my personal collection.\r\n\r\n4. [Steve B] As a concert attendee, I would like to make my media available to other attendees, and encourage them to link and remix it, but:\r\n\r\n    a. to be credited for any use of the material on other peoples' services\r\n\r\n    b. to know how and where it has been used and accessed (for my own credit, satisfaction, etc.).\r\n\r\n5. [Steve B] As a musician and concert organizer, I would like it to be easier to maintain presence across a variety of online media so that I can keep all my online presence more up to date and accurate\r\n\r\n\r\n## The proposal \r\n\r\nImagine that performance tickets are printed with (say) a QR code that links to an online resource that is a Digital Music Object.  Or, if concert bookings are processed online, an \"e-ticket\" could be a document that links to such an object.  The exact mechanism is not important, but I imagine it being integrated with the purchase and distribution of performance tickets.  The key is that each attendee receives a personal link or token that can be used online to access a Digital Music Object. \r\n\r\nWhat does this DMO offer?  It could be like a personalised version of the performers' general web site, offering direct access to information and recordings that relate directly to the performance attended.  Here are some possibilities: \r\n\r\n- link to a downloadable and/or purchasable live recording of the performance attended (a kind of \"official bootleg\"?) \r\n- a set list for the performance attended, \r\n- for each composition on the set list, links to more detailed information; e.g., composer, performers and instruments, recording and performance history of the composition, information about variations, downloadable and/or purchasable recordings, sheet music, etc. \r\n- more detailed information about the performers seen (recordings, compositions, other associations, links to other ensembles with which they have performed, etc.). \r\n- \"family tree\" for the ensemble seen (past members, past recordings and general history). \r\n- future performances by the performers seen \r\n- future recordings to be released by the performers seen \r\n- links to critical and/or scholarly reviews of the performance and performers' work \r\n- sharable links to music samples that audience members can use to recommend the performers to their friends, etc. \r\n- links to details of instruments used, \r\n- links to settings used for keyboards, sound processing equipment, etc. \r\n\r\nThe online Digital Music Object could further be a dynamic entity, providing updated information about performers' future activities as and when they become known, or providing time-limited access to downloadable recordings.  It might also provide links to social networking features that would allow performance attendees to communicate with each other and/or the performers about their experience of and thoughts about the performance and related material.  Links might be provided to Wikipedia-like resources that can be used for crowdsourcing reviews of performances. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Technical outline \r\n\r\nMost of the Digital Music Object resources offered are based on existing technologies and platforms.  The \"Performance DMO\" would mainly be an aggregation of basic information and references to resources.  I expect we would build upon ideas developed for Research Objects (Linked data, ORE, annotations, etc.). \r\n\r\n\r\n## Minimum viable product \r\n\r\nI see a minimal viable product for a \"Performance DMO\" consisting of something like: \r\n\r\n1. overview of the performance (who, where, when) \r\n2. a list of compositions performed (title, composer, performers, etc.) \r\n3. some feedback mechanism to allow audience feedback to the performers - this might be as simple as a \"like\" button, or allow more nuanced forms of feedback.  The DMO content might just be a (personalised?) link to an existing service.\r\n",
